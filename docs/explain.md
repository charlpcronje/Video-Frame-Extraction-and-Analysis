# Code Explanation for Video Frame Extraction and Analysis App

## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the code, logic blocks, and usage examples for the Video Frame Extraction and Analysis Flask Application.

### Frame Extraction Function
- **Purpose**: To extract every frame from an MP4 file and save them as high-quality PNG images.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```python
  # Example usage of frame extraction
  extract_frames("path/to/video.mp4", "path/to/output/folder")
  ```

### Image Analysis Function
- **Purpose**: To analyze the sharpness of images and move the sharpest ones to a different folder.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```python
  # Example usage of image analysis
  move_sharp_images("path/to/source/folder", "path/to/target/folder", 100)
  ```

### Flask Endpoints
- **/extract_frames**: Endpoint to trigger frame extraction process.
- **/analyze_images**: Endpoint to analyze extracted frames and move sharp images.

### Command-Line Interface
- The application can also be used via the command line with arguments for extracting frames or analyzing images.

## Detailed Code Explanation
[Here, provide a detailed breakdown of the code logic, explaining each function and logic block within the application.]

### `extract_frames` Function
- **Purpose**: Extracts frames from a video file.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
    extract_frames("path/to/video.mp4", "path/to/output/folder", frames_to_skip=2, total_images_to_extract=50)
  ```

### `move_sharp_images` Function
- **Purpose**: Analyzes images for sharpness and moves sharp ones to a specified folder.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  move_sharp_images("path/to/source/folder", "path/to/sharp/images/folder", sharpness_threshold=100)
  ```

### `generate_collage` Function
- **Purpose**: Generates a collage from a folder of images.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  generate_collage("path/to/frames/folder", "path/to/collage/folder")
  ```
```
